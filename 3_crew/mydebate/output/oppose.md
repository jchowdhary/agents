The assertion that AI LLMs are inherently a threat overlooks their potential when properly safeguarded. AI LLMs, like any technology, require strict and well-crafted policies to prevent misuse and mitigate risks. When adequately regulated—through transparent oversight, ethical standards, and accountability measures—these models can deliver immense societal benefits, such as advancing healthcare, education, and innovation. Proper policies do not hinder progress; they ensure AI remains a tool that serves humanity’s interests securely, refuting the idea that AI LLMs are threats; instead, they become controlled assets under vigilant regulation.
