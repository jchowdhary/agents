AI language models represent a profound threat to humanity because their unchecked growth can enable malicious actors to exploit them for misinformation, cyber-attacks, and manipulation, destabilizing societies and eroding trust. Without strict regulation, these models can perpetuate harmful biases, infringe on privacy rights, and automate decisions that negatively impact individuals and groups. Moreover, the rapid advancement of AI LLMs risks creating autonomous systems capable of acting outside human oversight, raising existential risks. Implementing strict regulations is essential to prevent misuse, ensure transparency, hold developers accountable, and protect humanity from potential catastrophic consequences while allowing responsible innovation.
